  <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>As I reflect on my semester in Writing with Digital Technologies, I'm reminded of how crucial it is to stay open to learning new things, even when you're unsure how or if they’ll benefit you. Learning anything is never a waste. What feels like an inconsequential skill today could turn out to be exactly what you need tomorrow. The tools and skills I picked up this semester will be something I continue to build upon throughout my professional life.</p>
     <p>For me, one of the most exciting parts of the course was learning to format a book using LibreOffice. I didn’t expect to feel so motivated about something like printing my own book, but after the professor’s demonstration and a guided tour of a print-on-demand website, I was amazed at how easy it was. It felt empowering to see how accessible and affordable it is to self-publish in today’s world. Living in this age of technology is incredible. If someone from 100 years ago could see the opportunities we have now, they'd be speechless.</p>
     <p>At the start of the semester, I wasn’t sure whether I should choose a niche technical skill to master or accept that I’m a generalist. I worried that I faded into the crowd, that I didn’t have skills that set me apart from other applicants in the job market. I was feeling anxious about not knowing enough to land a good job. However over the semester, I overcame those false and limiting beliefs. I know I’m a smart person full of great ideas, straightforward and independent. I have traits that are valued by people universally. I see now that being versatile is more beneficial while I fall into my ideal career. I'd rather be flexible and test out a wide range of industries. This approach feels more in line with how I work best and how I see my career unfolding.  I can worry about the rest later.</p> 
     <p>I’ve learned that my options are limitless since I only aim to blend my interests in writing, technology, and communication and find a positive and balanced workplace community. While I’m not yet certain about my specific career path, I now see that fields aside from technical writing would be a good fit for me too. I feel more confident in my ability to explore different paths within the tech and communication sectors.</p>
     <p>The digital tools I’ve worked with this semester have given me the knowledge I need to adapt to a variety of careers. These tools will undoubtedly help me succeed in industries like technology, healthcare, and education, where clear communication is key.</p>
     <p>Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue developing the writing skills I’ve learned. Digital literacy isn’t something you just learn once and leave behind, it’s an ongoing process. New technologies and tools are always emerging, and I plan to stay on top of them by attending conferences, webinars, and workshops. I also want to get more involved with open-source projects, where I can collaborate with others and learn from a community. The value of continuously learning, staying adaptable, and seeking out new challenges cannot be understated. College pushed me to seek things that will help me grow as a professional and an individual.</p>
