<p>Throughout my childhood, my grandmother was full of vibrant laughter and hymns to sing as she expertly pressed the keys of her piano. But in recent years, her mind began to change. While she always sent cards or sang happy birthday over the phone to every child and grandchild, she now lost track of the days, that once-impeccable sense of time fading into the past. What started as forgetfulness surrounding errands and appointments progressed into something more insidious. Leaving her friends at bridge club behind without a goodbye, and allowing her children to sell her home and belongings, she now lives in a facility with nearly no ability to care for herself. Watching her personality change, as well as her ability to recognize even those closest to her, left me wondering: could her quick decline have been prevented? And for others in my family, is there a way to detect Alzheimer’s early, before it causes them irreversible damage? If we could have done something to preserve her quality of life, to enable her to live independently and enjoy her beloved home longer, we would have.</p>
<p>This personal experience is not unique. Millions of families are dealing with similar concerns, and it’s one that scientists are actively working to answer. Tristan Freese, a development scientist at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, is part of that effort. Beckman Coulter specializes in diagnostic solutions used in complex clinical testing, which are found in hospitals, laboratories and physician office settings around the globe. Tristan works on immunoassays, tests designed to detect specific biomarkers in blood or other biological samples. His team is now focusing on using immunoassays to detect neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS before the symptoms are noticeable.</p> 
<p>A reference page on Beckman Coulter’s website explains that, as our global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is only going to increase. Advances in healthcare and higher life expectancies mean that more people are living longer, but it also means that neurodegenerative diseases are becoming more common. The need for better diagnostic tools and treatments has never been more urgent. It’s an exciting frontier in medical science, with huge potential to transform our approach to these diseases. </p>

<p>Recent studies have shown promising results of testing for Alzheimer biomarkers, with blood tests achieving 90% accuracy (Palmqvist et al., 2024). Imagine a routine blood test, similar to the ones we already use to recognize markers of conditions like anemia, cancer, and diabetes. Perhaps you’re going in for your annual check-up, and with a family history of early neurodegenerative diseases on your chart, the doctor suggests it’s time to start running a panel for dementia. In the best-case scenario, the doctor explains, the tests could indicate you’re at risk, but the disease hasn’t yet taken hold. The results come back with trace amounts of specific biomarkers, suggesting that a neurodegenerative disease is beginning to develop. You can take this information as a prompt to start preparing for your future. This early warning system could provide invaluable time to begin treatments that could slow the disease and preserve quality of life.</p>
<p>The detection of neurodegenerative diseases years before cognitive or motor symptoms even appear is what researchers are working toward. Before a person experiences the tell-tale signs of Alzheimer’s, the disease progresses from an initially asymptomatic stage. But even without symptoms, biological changes may occur in the brain-which is what researchers want to pinpoint. Current diagnostic methods, such as brain imaging or cognitive testing, typically identify these diseases only after significant brain damage has already occurred. But with the advent of immunoassays, we may be able to detect these conditions much earlier, when interventions could still have a meaningful impact. For example, drugs that target amyloid plaques or tau tangles in Alzheimer’s are currently under development, but their efficacy is likely to be higher if administered early in the disease process.</p>
<p>Although neurodegenerative diseases cannot be prevented, the earlier the diagnosis, the more treatment options will be available. The FDA has recently approved drugs that change disease progression in people living with Alzheimer's, called Donanemab (Kisunla) and Lecanemab (Leqembi), but thus far they’ve been proven effective only for cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia. Once Alzheimer's progresses to later stages, more brain cells die and connections among cells are irreversibly lost, so at this point drugs can only help to lessen or stabilize symptoms for a limited time.</p>
<p>Immunoassays are diagnostic tests that use antibodies to detect specific biomarkers (proteins or other molecules) in blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These tests leverage the body’s natural immune response. When the body encounters harmful invaders like viruses or bacteria, it produces antibodies to flag and neutralize them. In immunoassays, these antibodies can also be designed to bind to disease-specific proteins—biomarkers that are indicative of diseases like cancer, infections, and neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known uses of immunoassays is in pregnancy tests. In this case, antibodies detect the presence of the hormone hCG in urine, signaling pregnancy. Similarly, COVID-19 tests detect viral proteins or antibodies in a person’s saliva or nasal swab to determine whether they are infected. These examples show how immunoassays can provide reliable, real-time results using relatively small samples.</p>
<p>In the case of neurodegenerative diseases, scientists are focusing on identifying specific biomarkers that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These include proteins such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, and TDP-43. Each of these biomarkers has a distinct pattern of accumulation in the brain that correlates with different stages and types of neurodegenerative diseases. Some examples of the biomarkers currently being studied are as follows:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>Amyloid-beta (Aβ): In Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid-beta plaques accumulate in the brain, disrupting cell function. Detecting Aβ levels in blood or CSF can potentially signal the onset of Alzheimer’s long before cognitive symptoms become evident (Arendt, P., et al., (2024).</li> 
<li>Tau:  The presence of tau in the brain can indicate the progression of Alzheimer’s. In the early stages of the disease, tau begins to accumulate and form tangles inside neurons, disrupting their function (Bisi, N., et al., 2024).</li> 
<li>TDP-43: This protein is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and dementia. Abnormalities in TDP-43 can be detected in blood or CSF samples (Luthi-Carter, R., et al., 2024).</li> 
</ul>
<p>By detecting these biomarkers, immunoassays could provide a snapshot of what’s happening inside the brain before symptoms ever appear. This would be a game-changer for early diagnosis, allowing for interventions that could slow or even halt disease progression.

<p>An early diagnosis allows patients and families to plan ahead. Caregivers can access support services, and patients can begin therapies to manage symptoms, preserve cognitive function, and maintain independence for as long as possible. A recently published report by The Lancet reveals that nearly half of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 modifiable risk factors.</p>
<p>The potential of immunoassays is a beacon of hope for the future of our elderly population. We might be able to change the course of people’s lives. For individuals like my grandmother, an early diagnosis could have allowed us to access treatments and interventions that might have slowed her decline. For others, it could mean better care, better quality of life, and perhaps even a future where these diseases are no longer a death sentence.</p>
<p>As scientists like Tristan refine these diagnostic tools, and as companies like Beckman Coulter work to make these tests more accessible and affordable, we edge closer to a future where a simple blood test could save lives. A future where diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS no longer steal the moments that matter most.</p>
