  <blockquote>The biggest thing was definitely my getting on that bike and creating new adventures for myself. Now I’m 74. I just passed the 5-year, 70% mark [mortality rate for ischemic stroke] and I feel great. I don’t feel like I’m getting older. I feel like every day I am improving. This trike has been incredibly important in my rehabilitation. Physically and mentally (John Parker, 2024).</blockquote>
<p>When I first met John Parker, we chatted about his cherished red trike at the bike racks outside The Lakeside Center, an office building in Minneapolis. He pointed out some modifications made by his local bike shop, Perennial Cycle. A mechanic had relocated the brakes and shifter to the right side of his handlebars because John's left hand didn't have enough strength to control them. He mentioned that initially, he had to use a leather strap to secure his left foot to the pedal to prevent it from falling off. However, through persistence, he regained enough mobility to remove the strap.</p>
<p>John, a stroke survivor in his 70s, faced significant physical challenges after a stroke impaired his balance and limited his mobility. Before his stroke, physical activity had been a lifelong source of joy for him. Throughout his adult years, John invested in his health and could often be found running on his favorite indoor track. He fondly recalls learning to ride his first bike as a young boy, which opened up a new world for him: <q>It was the greatest adventure.</q> After the stroke, he yearned to regain that sense of freedom. With the help of a specially designed trike, John experienced a remarkable transformation in his rehabilitation journey.</p>
<p>Adaptive cycling offers a valuable opportunity for independence, particularly for individuals with limited walking abilities. For people with significant coordination challenges, such as post-stroke patients, adaptations enable them to optimize their physical capabilities (Gjessing & Jahnsen, 2023). Research shows that cycling serves as an effective rehabilitative tool, significantly improving motor function, lower-body muscle strength, aerobic capacity, balance, and overall cardiovascular fitness (Febritasari & Batan, 2019). Additionally, tricycles not only enhance physical mobility but also boost individuals' sense of independence, identity, and quality of life.</p>
<p>Bicycles can be customized to meet individual needs through various adjustments, such as specialized pedals, handlebars, and upper body support (Gjessing, Nyquist, & Jahnsen, 2022). In the Paralympics, classifications for para-cycling are based on four types of equipment: upright bicycles, handcycles, tricycles, and tandem bicycles, where athletes with visual impairments compete with a sighted &quot;pilot&quot; at the front.</p>
<p>At the age of 69, John experienced an Ischemic stroke while working out at his gym. He feels fortunate to have been in a public space, surrounded by people who could help; his last memory of that day is a stranger calling for an ambulance. John later found himself at the Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Institute’s transitional nursing facility, facing two months of memory loss. As fragments of his memory returned, he learned to navigate life with paralysis, relying on his unaffected arm to maneuver his wheelchair since he could not use his left arm and leg.</p> 
<p>During his rehabilitation stay, he participated in various hands-on therapies designed to retrain his strength and balance. However, he soon grew frustrated with the limitations imposed by his stroke, which fueled his determination to learn to walk again. And, despite enduring 34 falls, he persevered and succeeded. If beating the odds and rejoining society as an independent man was not enough, John even revisited distance swimming, a hobby of his earlier in life - pushing through to swim 100 yards in Cedar Lake.</p>
<p>Next, John set a new goal: to ride a bike again. With the belief that nothing was beyond his reach and the support of his physical therapist, he climbed onto a standard two-wheeled bike. However, balance impairment is common among stroke survivors, and weakness on one side of his body made riding unsafe. After experiencing an additional fall from the bike, he began searching for alternatives, soon discovering an online listing for the machine that could help him reclaim some of his former life. </p>

<h2>Cycling and Identity</h2>

<p>I worked at Perennial Cycle for two years. Although I had never spoken to John before, I recognized his trike from the time he brought it into the shop for service. Perennial specializes in “alternative transportation,” including various types of trikes. The dedicated mechanics at Perennial are known for their commitment to understanding the individual needs of each customer. Longtime bicycle mechanics Luke, Karl, and Hunter strive to make cycling accessible and encourage as many people as possible to get on wheels.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting people with neurological conditions like strokes or brain injuries, adaptive cycling benefits people with a range of disabilities. Customers with conditions such as spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, amputations, or arthritis have all visited Perennial Cycle. I often encountered avid cyclists with limited mobility who were remarkably more determined to ride than the majority of people.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm cyclists have for their lifestyle is undeniable, and the special relationship between people and their bikes makes sense, particularly in the context of disability. In a world designed primarily for able-bodied people, opportunities for people with varied abilities to engage on an equal footing are often scarce. Cycling can be an equalizer - and feeling capable brings confidence and pride. As Gjessing points out, individuals need to find an activity they can master and enjoy. This is especially important for people with disabilities, who often become chronically sedentary; aligning with a person’s intrinsic motivation is crucial (Gjessing, Nyquist, & Jahnsen, 2022).</p> 
<p>Fortunately, the bike infrastructure in Minneapolis makes cycling a convenient and viable option for achieving this. Named the best large U.S. city for biking in 2024, Minneapolis values individuals with disabilities as an integral part of the cycling community. When you ride along popular trails like the Midtown Greenway, you're likely to encounter people on seriously unique machines.</p>
<p>John's story is proof of the magic of cycling and how something seemingly simple can foster a sense of identity, helping people engage socially and connect with their surroundings. Beyond being a personal triumph, though, this story emphasizes the importance of access to resources for those navigating similar challenges. Having experienced the transformative power of cycling firsthand, John has become an advocate for providing opportunities to others in rehabilitation. He is donating several trikes to the Courage Kenney Rehabilitation Institute, where he underwent physical therapy, hoping to instill a sense of hope in the patients there as well.</p>
<p>The stories of individuals like John Parker serve as important reminders of the value of accessibility. Adaptive cycling is a solution to bridge the gap between physical limitations and active participation in one’s community. As we explore and promote the use of adaptive equipment, it’s crucial to create environments that encourage physical activity and empower individuals on their recovery journeys. This morning, while biking along the Greenway, I saw a red trike coming toward me, and John was sitting happily on it. He was a shining reminder to smile more at the people I pass by, as you truly never know what challenges they have faced to reach where they are today.</p>
