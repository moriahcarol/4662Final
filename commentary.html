  <h2>Commentary</h2>
     <p>As you can see, this project was presented using GitHub Pages. I chose to complete my final using this technology because HTML/CSS are foundational web technologies and relatively easy to learn, especially for beginners like me.</p>
<p>If one thing is clear, HTML and CSS afford the user full control over how the entire website looks and works. When coding from scratch and minimal knowledge, there’s a slim margin for error. It took longer than I expected, but it was definitely a valuable learning experience!</p>
<p>The major upside of HTML is the ability to fine-tune content and its presentation. I could structure my essays, commentary, and reflection logically while customizing the design to my liking. With CSS, I was able to adjust font sizes, spacing, colors, and layout to make the site look decent. I actually enjoyed how everything relied upon me and the tiny details, like putting together a puzzle.</p> 
<p>Another big plus was that HTML and CSS are widely used, which meant I had tons of resources to help me troubleshoot. Websites like W3Schools were a lifesaver. They offered simple examples which made the learning very accessible.</p>
<p>Of course, there were some downsides. Every design tweak like adjusting margins and aligning text had to be done manually. In the beginning, I was scouring my code to find a missing semicolon. In the end, I committed a million changes since I was flipping back and forth through my pages to change minor details. I admit I’m a perfectionist, but I still hope no one on the internet looks at my commit history, embarrassing haha.</p>
<p>Another limitation of GitHub Pages is that it’s designed for static websites, meaning it doesn’t support dynamic features like user interactivity, real-time updates, or data collection. If I’d wanted to add those kinds of features, I would have needed to use a different platform. But since my project was about presenting a static site, this wasn’t an issue.</p>
<p>Overall, using HTML/CSS for my project was a great decision. While there were a few hurdles along the way, the experience taught me a lot. It was actually enjoyable to hunt down the answers to my questions in coding forums. In the end, the benefits, especially the simplicity of using GitHub Pages, definitely outweighed the challenges.</p>
